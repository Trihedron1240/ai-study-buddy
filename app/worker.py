"""Background worker functions.

The worker is executed by an RQ worker process and is responsible for turning
uploaded documents into searchable chunks with vector embeddings.  The real
project will eventually contain sophisticated parsing and embedding logic, but
for the purposes of this example we use a very small, selfâ€‘contained
implementation.
