# AI Study Buddy with Memory

An AI-powered study assistant that:
- Generates flashcards from any notes, PDFs, or lecture transcripts.
- Uses spaced repetition to maximize retention.
- Tracks your knowledge health over time.
- Acts like a personal coach, telling you exactly what to study each day.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Queue:** Redis + RQ (for background processing)
- **Frontend:** Next.js (later in the build)
- **AI Processing:** LangFlow + PyTorch (custom models later)

## Goals for MVP
1. Upload notes → auto-generate flashcards.
2. Daily study plan from the coach system.
3. Memory tracking + spaced repetition.
4. Launch closed beta within 8 weeks.
